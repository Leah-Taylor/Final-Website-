Although we did not completely finish a few elements of our website, such as the media queries, we hope you still enjoy looking at it.  
 
For our project, we chose to do the JCM Early College High School Computer Club. We used our school colors (dark green and gold) in a gradient style for our header, which I think is very appealing to the eye. We tried to make our website look fun but also professional. In making this website, we really wanted to show all the activities, benefits, and all of the dedicated members of the JCM-ECH Computer Club. 
 
Unfortunately, my partner baceame sick and was unable to finish his part of the website. However, I was able to finish it with the help of my classmates.
 
Thank you for looking at our website and I hope we get to see you all soon.
